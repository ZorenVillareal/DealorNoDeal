  <p>
    1    Deal or No Deal is a game show where you have the chance to win a large cash prize.

  </p>
  <p>
    2    At the beginning of the game, there are 26 briefcases, each containing a hidden amount of money. The amounts range from $1 to $2,000,000.

  </p>
  <p>
    3    You will select one briefcase as your own, which remains unopened throughout the game.

  </p>

  <p>
  4    The remaining briefcases are opened one by one, revealing the amounts of money inside.
</p>
    <p>
      5    After a certain number of briefcases are opened, the "banker" will make you an offer to buy your unopened briefcase.

  </p>
  <p>
    6    You have to decide whether to accept the banker's offer ("Deal") or keep playing and hope that your unopened briefcase contains a higher amount of money ("No Deal").

  </p>
  <p>
    7    The game continues until you either accept a deal or open all the briefcases.

  </p>
  <p>
    8    If you decide to continue playing, the banker will make new offers after each round of briefcase openings.

  </p>
  <p>
    9    At the end of the game, if you haven't accepted any offers, you will keep the amount of money in your original briefcase.

  </p>
  <p>
    10    The objective of the game is to try and get the highest possible amount of money by making strategic decisions on when to accept deals and when to keep playing.
